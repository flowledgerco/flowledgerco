            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: December 15, 2025</p>
            
            <p>Finch & Poppy LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the FlowLedger mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
            
            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you. FlowLedger is designed to keep your data local on your device. We do not collect or transmit your financial data to our servers unless explicitly shared by you (e.g., via exports).</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). This may include email addresses for invoicing or contact purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> The app stores transaction details, budgets, invoices, receipts, mileage logs, and tax estimates locally on your device. This includes amounts, dates, merchants, categories, and notes. Data is secured with biometric/passcode protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information on how the Service is accessed and used, such as app version and device type, for diagnostics.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> For mileage tracking, we collect location data (with permission) to calculate distances and deductions. This is stored locally and not shared.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera/Photos Data:</strong> For receipt scanning, we access your camera or photo library (with permission) to process images via on-device OCR. Images are stored locally.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Use of Data</h3>
            <p>FlowLedger uses the collected data for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing financial tracking features (e.g., budgets, reports, tax estimates).</li>
                <li>Automating tasks like recurring transactions and notifications.</li>
                <li>Improving app performance and security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not share your data with third parties except as required by law or with your explicit consent (e.g., exports).</p>
            
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Data, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Data is stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework, with optional biometric encryption.</p>
            
            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
