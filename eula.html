            <h2>7. Consent to Use of Data</h2>
            <p>You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.</p>
            <p>You retain ownership of data you enter into the Software ("User Data"). By using the Software, you grant us a limited license to process and store User Data solely to provide the Software's functionality.</p>
            <p>All User Data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or transmit your financial data to servers unless explicitly shared by you. You are responsible for the accuracy of User Data and for backing it up. We are not liable for data loss. For details on data types (e.g., location for mileage, camera for receipts), see our <a href="https://floptimizer.github.io/FLO/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
         
            <h2>8. Updates and Modifications</h2>
            <p>We may provide updates to the Software. You must install updates to continue using it. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue features without notice.</p>
         
            <h2>9. Third-Party Components and External Services</h2>
            <p>The Software may include third-party software (e.g., open-source libraries) governed by their own licenses. Apple iOS terms also apply.</p>
            <p>The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.</p>
            <h3>Future Bank Linking (Plaid)</h3>
            <p>Future versions of the Software may include optional bank account linking using Plaid Inc.'s secure platform. This feature allows users to connect their bank accounts to automate transaction imports and budget tracking, assisting with tax reports. It is completely optional, and no personal information is transmitted to the FLO team—all data remains on your personal devices.</p>
            <p>When using Plaid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User consent is required for all connections.</li>
                <li>Bank credentials are handled transiently and not stored long-term by Plaid.</li>
                <li>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with bank-level security measures.</li>
                <li>Users have rights to access, rectify, erase, and port their data.</li>
                <li>Plaid does not sell user data and shares it only as necessary for the service (e.g., with financial institutions and the integrating app).</li>
                <li>Transaction data is used for services like fraud prevention and insights but remains under user control.</li>
                <li>Users can manage connections and delete data via Plaid's portal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will be subject to Plaid's terms (<a href="https://plaid.com/legal" target="_blank">plaid.com/legal</a>). We are not responsible for Plaid's services or data handling.</p>
